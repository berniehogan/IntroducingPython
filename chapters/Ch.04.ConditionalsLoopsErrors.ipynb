For example we would have a set of things, `characters = {\"Kermit\",\"Piggy\",\"Fozzie\"}` and if we ask `\"Kermit\" in characters\"` the program will return `True`. "

We then saw how we could use this in `if` statements in order to do something under some conditions. Then we looked at loops, first the for loop, followed by list comprehensions and while loops. In each case, we were able to direct the flow of a program by doing something for each element of a collection. Finally, we explored errors, which are ways in which we can halt a program entirely (as well as how to catch these errors so our program does not halt if we can anticipate that error). \n",

But now it would be worth thinking about how we can collect many of these operations in a single place if we want to use them together repeatedly. This single place with be a function. Then with a function we can really start to create programs with a variety of structures depending on our needs. You can see this in the next chapter. "
